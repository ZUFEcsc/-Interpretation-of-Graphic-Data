# Interpretation-of-Graphic-Data

This is a big job I wrote in Java in my freshman year.

It mainly uses data visualization to analyze and present graph data. 

And the main views are :
  the projection map of nodes,
  the force-oriented map of network layout,
  the force-oriented map of community distribution,
  the histogram of the degree of nodes,
  the sum of the degree of edges and mediums.

  In this work,my team members have helped me a lot .Thanks very much for my team members.
